The game will be an space invader blaster game. It will be single player.
The player will be able to choose between 3 different types of ships, each with
unique characteristics involving speed, size, and damage. The objective is to
score as many points and to last as long as you can against the army. As such, it is 
not a "winnable" game but a game to get the highest score. The rules are to shoot down
space invaders before they get to your side. You will appear as a ship on the bottom of
the screen, and the invaders will appear from the top. They slowly descend down and will
reach the bottom unless destroyed. You have a "health" bar that decreases when you take
damage, either from the enemy bullets hitting your ship, or enemies passing the bottom.

Resources exist in the form of items. Occasionally, items will drop that either boost speed,
increase health, or increase speed. They last until the ship is damaged. Game state goes
along with sequencing, in the sense that there are rounds to the game. Each round presents
a wave of enemies with the same characteristic. However, when the round is over, the next
wave will have a new characteristic, making each round more difficult. This could be
stronger enemy bullets, tankier enemies, or faster descent. 

The design for 11 entities is as follows:
There will be 3 entities for the different type of ships, each with varying capabilities.
There will be 3 entities for items that are dropped, each with different boosts.
There will be 3 kinds of enemies, also with different capabilities.
There will be 2 kinds of bullets, enemy bullets and player bullets.
